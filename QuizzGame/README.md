# Quizz-Game
The game contains several questions based on the Linux operating system. This game was created using Meteor and React to improve my skills in both technologies.
## Development highlights
### #1
Today I was able to understand better the use of ```{useState and useEffect}``` React hooks and use a lot of ```arrays.functions``` provided by the ES6. Such functions
are ```array.map array.forEach array.map array.filter array.reduce array.join```. Other very helpful function used today was ``` Object(object).keys() ```
