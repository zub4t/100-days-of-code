# Quizz-Game
The game contains several questions based on the Linux operating system. This game was created using Meteor and React to improve my skills in both technologies.
## Development highlights
### #1
Today I was able to understand better the use of ```{useState and useEffect}``` React hooks and use a lot of ```arrays.functions``` provided by the ES6. Such functions
are ```array.map array.forEach array.map array.filter array.reduce array.join```. Other very helpful function used today was ``` Object(object).keys() ```
### #2 
Today I work a lot in managing the score and showing it to the user. Also, the user now can make login with his GitHub account. This was too easy due to meteor js, I have always wondered how can this type of login can be built, and now I can do it with a few lines of code<img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/58067-pepe_naruto/download" width="30"> <br/>
### #3
Today is the end of this project. During the development process, I was able to better understand meteor js and React as well. However, I feel that there is still a lot to be understood. One of the key concepts to seek for is how the hook ```useTracker``` works under the hood. This project was deployed using meteor galaxy and is hosted at https://quizz.100daysofcode.meteorapp.com
