<h1> TeclaFast </h1>
This is the second project in the #100DayOfCode series. The goals of this project are to improve my C# and Windows Forms skills and also my typing skills <span> <img

<h2> Development Highlights </h>
<h3> #1 </h3>
today I put my C# XD skills into practice and I realize that I was a little rusty so I didn't do much, more than that I realize that in addition to looking simple, Windows Forms can be quite difficult. Current difficulties are related to background tasks that need to be done.
I saw an article by MicroSoft showing how to use BackgroundWorkers to do this.<br/>
